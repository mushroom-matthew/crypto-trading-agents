## Background

Crypto markets never close. Building an automated trading system therefore demands:

- **Continuous orchestration** – agents must coordinate 24×7 without downtime.
- **Deterministic audit trails** – regulators require you to replay the exact decision path for every trade.
- **Cross-venue execution** – liquidity lives on both CEXs and DEXs; routing logic has to be durable.

Temporal supplies resilient workflows while MCP gives agents a shared, tool-based contract. This repo combines them into a modular engine you can extend one agent at a time.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main agents working together:

### 🏆 Single Interface Design

The **Broker Agent** serves as the sole user interface, providing access to all system functionality including trading, performance analysis, and evaluation triggering.

### 🤖 Execution Agent

The execution agent is the core trading decision-maker in the system:

- **Automated Trading**: Receives scheduled nudges every 25 seconds to evaluate market conditions and execute trades
- **Dynamic Adaptation**: System prompts are continuously updated by the Judge Agent based on performance
- **User Alignment**: Incorporates user preferences (risk tolerance, trading style) and feedback into decision-making
- **Portfolio Management**: Queries portfolio status and recent historical ticks before making buy/sell/hold decisions

### 🔄 LLM as Judge Agent

The judge agent continuously monitors performance and automatically optimizes the execution agent:

1. **Performance Monitoring**: Evaluates trading performance dynamically (10-minute startup delay, then adaptive timing)
2. **Decision Analysis**: Uses GPT-4o to analyze decision quality and timing
3. **Prompt Optimization**: Automatically updates execution agent prompts based on performance
4. **Risk Management**: Switches to conservative mode during poor performance periods

Each block corresponds to one or more MCP tools (Temporal workflows) described below.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

| Requirement  | Version       | Notes                                         |
| ------------ | ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Python       | 3.11 or newer | Data & strategy agents                        |
| Temporal CLI | 1.24+         | `brew install temporal` or use Temporal Cloud |
| tmux         | latest        | Required for `run_stack.sh` start script      |

Required environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` – enables the broker and execution agents to use OpenAI models.
- `COINBASE_API_KEY` / `COINBASE_API_SECRET` – Coinbase App (CDP) API key pair; secrets can be pasted directly from the downloaded JSON (newlines are supported).
- `COINBASE_WALLET_SECRET` – optional, only required for wallet-authenticated POST/DELETE calls. Leave empty for read-only trading.
- `COINBASEEXCHANGE_API_KEY` and `COINBASEEXCHANGE_SECRET` – legacy Advanced Trade credentials (fallback if you still need HMAC auth).
- `TEMPORAL_ADDRESS`, `TEMPORAL_NAMESPACE` and `TASK_QUEUE` – Temporal connection settings (defaults are shown in `.env`).
- `MCP_PORT` – port for the MCP server (defaults to `8080`).
- `HISTORICAL_MINUTES` – minutes of historical data to load on startup (defaults to `60` for 1 hour).

### Preparing Coinbase Wallets for Live Trading

1. **Fund Coinbase wallets** – Deposit ETH and BTC into the Coinbase account tied to your API key. Only these balances will be used; no transfers occur until you explicitly allow trading.
2. **Seed the ledger** – Pull wallets/balances into the internal database so Temporal workflows see real holdings:
   ```bash
   UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python -m app.cli.main ledger seed-from-coinbase
   ```
3. **Inspect wallet IDs and cached balances** – Use the new wallet inspector to note the `wallet_id` for ETH and BTC:
   ```bash
   UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python -m app.cli.main wallet list
   ```
4. **Mark 20% as tradable** – For each funded wallet, set the tradeable fraction to `0.20` (repeat per wallet):
   ```bash
   UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python -m app.cli.main wallet set-tradeable-fraction <wallet_id> 0.20
   ```
   These fractions gate how much the execution agent may reserve or spend per wallet.
5. **Reconcile before trading** – Confirm ledger entries match Coinbase using the reconciliation tool:
   ```bash
   UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python -m app.cli.main reconcile run
   ```
6. **Dry-run trading flows** – Keep `RUN_MODE=dev` (or disable actual order placement in prompts) while observing the broker/execution agents. Only remove the guard once you’re satisfied with monitoring, risk limits, and logging.

### Quick Setup (local dev)

```bash
# Clone and bootstrap
git clone https://github.com/your-org/durable-crypto-agents.git
cd durable-crypto-agents

# Activate Python env
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install uv
uv sync

### Coinbase Ledger & Trading

The production ledger stack lives under `app/` and exposes a CLI for seeding wallets, reserving balances, and placing live trades via Coinbase Advanced Trade.

1. Copy environment defaults and update with your credentials:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies and start the Postgres service with migrations:

   ```bash
   make init
   make db-up
   ```

3. Seed wallets directly from Coinbase (creates internal ledger balances and reservations backing):

   ```bash
   uv run python -m app.cli.main ledger seed-from-coinbase
   ```

4. Configure what fraction of each wallet is available to the trading bots:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m app.cli.main wallet set-tradeable-fraction --wallet 1 --frac 0.5
   ```

5. Place a cost-gated trade:

   ```bash
   uv run python -m app.cli.main trade place \
     --wallet 1 \
     --product BTC-USD \
     --side buy \
     --qty 0.01 \
     --notional 300 \
     --expected-edge 15 \
     --idempotency-key demo-trade-001
   ```

6. Reconcile the internal ledger with Coinbase balances (writes a drift report to stdout):

   ```bash
   uv run python -m app.cli.main reconcile run --threshold 0.0001
   ```

### Web Dashboard (Human Supervisor)

Replace the tmux-based workflow with a lightweight web UI that supervises all agents, shows ledger snapshots, and keeps a human in the loop.

```bash
UV_CACHE_DIR=.uv-cache uv run python -m app.dashboard
```

Open <http://localhost:8081/> to:

- Start/stop Temporal, the worker, MCP server, and broker/execution/judge agents from a single panel.
- Inspect Coinbase-linked wallets, tradable fractions, and balances per strategy/portfolio.
- Review the short-term backlog (see `docs/ROADMAP.md`) and plan future automation without leaving the UI.

# Launch the full stack
./run_stack.sh
```

Point your agent workers at `localhost:8080` (default MCP port) and confirm health at <http://localhost:8080/healthz>.

## Demo

The quickest way to see the stack in action is to run the included `run_stack.sh` script which launches everything in a single `tmux` session.

```bash
./run_stack.sh
```

This starts the Temporal dev server, Python worker, MCP server and several sample agents. Each component runs in its own `tmux` pane so you can watch log output as orders flow through the system. Detach from the session with `Ctrl-b d` and reattach anytime by running the script again. Shutdown is as simple as ctrl+c in any tmux pane and then entering `tmux kill-server`

### Walking through the demo

1. Run the shell script `./run_stack.sh`
2. When prompted for trading pairs, tell the broker agent **"BTC/USD, ETH/USD, DOGE/USD"** (recommended 2-4 pairs for optimal performance).
3. `start_market_stream` automatically loads 1 hour of historical data, then spawns a `subscribe_cex_stream` workflow that broadcasts each ticker to its `ComputeFeatureVector` child.
4. The execution agent wakes up periodically via a scheduled workflow and analyzes market data to decide whether to trade using `place_mock_order`.
5. Filled orders are recorded in the `ExecutionLedgerWorkflow` with automatic profit scraping.
6. The judge agent monitors performance autonomously (10-minute startup delay) and can be queried through the broker:
   - **"How is the system performing?"** - Triggers evaluation and shows metrics
   - **"What's the transaction history?"** - Shows recent trades and fills
   - **"Evaluate performance"** - Forces immediate performance analysis

### 🤖 Interacting with the System

The broker agent serves as your single interface. Try these commands:

**Trading Commands:**

- `"Start trading BTC/USD and ETH/USD"` (or choose from expanded DeFi/Layer 2 options)
- `"What's my portfolio status?"` (includes profit scraping details)
- `"Show me recent transactions"`

**Performance Analysis:**

- `"How is the system performing?"`
- `"Trigger a performance evaluation"`
- `"Show me the latest evaluation results"`
- `"What are the current risk metrics?"`

**System Insights:**

- `"Show prompt evolution history"`
- `"What performance trends do you see?"`

`subscribe_cex_stream` automatically restarts itself via Temporal's _continue as new_
mechanism after a configurable number of cycles to prevent unbounded workflow
history growth. The default interval is one hour (3600 cycles) and can be
changed by setting the `STREAM_CONTINUE_EVERY` environment variable. The workflow
also checks its current history length and continues early when it exceeds
`STREAM_HISTORY_LIMIT` (defaults to 9000 events).
`ComputeFeatureVector` behaves the same way using the `VECTOR_CONTINUE_EVERY`
and `VECTOR_HISTORY_LIMIT` environment variables.

## 🧠 LLM as Judge System

The system implements a sophisticated "LLM as Judge" pattern for continuous self-improvement:

### Performance Evaluation Framework

- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Evaluates returns, risk management, decision quality, and consistency
- **Automated Scoring**: Combines quantitative metrics with LLM-based decision analysis
- **Trend Detection**: Identifies performance patterns and degradation early

### Dynamic Prompt Optimization

- **Template System**: Modular prompt components for different trading scenarios
- **Automatic Updates**: Switches between conservative, standard, and aggressive modes based on performance
- **Version Tracking**: Full history of prompt changes with performance attribution

### Intelligent Triggers

- **Poor Performance**: Automatic intervention when scores drop below thresholds
- **High Drawdown**: Emergency conservative mode activation
- **Overly Conservative**: Increased risk-taking when performance is too safe

### Example Evaluation Cycle

```python
# Triggered dynamically based on performance or on-demand via broker agent
1. Collect transaction history and portfolio metrics
2. Calculate quantitative performance (Sharpe, drawdown, win rate)
3. Use GPT-4o to analyze decision quality and timing
4. Generate weighted overall score across four dimensions
5. Determine if prompt updates are needed
6. Implement changes and track effectiveness
```

## 💰 Profit Scraping System

The system includes intelligent profit-taking to secure gains while maintaining trading capital:

### User-Configurable Profit Taking

- **Scraping Percentage**: Users set percentage of profits to secure (e.g., 20%)
- **Automatic Execution**: Applied to all profitable trades automatically
- **Separation of Concerns**: Scraped profits kept separate from trading capital
- **Portfolio Tracking**: Displays both available cash and total cash value

### Example Flow

```python
# User sets 20% profit scraping preference
# Trade: Buy BTC at $50,000, Sell at $55,000 = $5,000 profit
# Result: $4,000 reinvested, $1,000 scraped and secured
```
