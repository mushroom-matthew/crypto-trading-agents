# Roadmap & Backlog

Tracked items beyond the initial dashboard scope:

1. **Health & Alerting** – automated checks for Postgres, Temporal, and Coinbase connectivity with alerts when components fail or drift.
2. **Portfolio Automation** – scripts/agents to create Coinbase portfolios, transfer funds, and tag them with strategy metadata without manual intervention.
3. **Agent Self-Healing** – policies/services that auto-restart crashed agents or resubmit Temporal workflows based on heartbeat failures.
4. **Backtesting Orchestration** – integrate historical replay/backtesting runs into the dashboard with result summaries.
5. **Ledger Drift Alerts** – notifications when reconciliation exceeds thresholds or reservations remain active too long.

Contributions can expand or reprioritise this list as the dashboard matures.
