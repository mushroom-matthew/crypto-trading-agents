# Documentation Overview

Start here for current guidance. Older plans remain in this folder for historical reference.

## Current guides
- `next_steps.md` — concise state-of-the-world and what to tackle next (planner quality, risk geometry, RPR rebuild).
- `cap_risk_playbook.md` — how caps/risk behave now, how to run the cap/risk matrices, and what metrics to watch.

## Historical/legacy references
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `RISK_AUDIT.md`, `RISK_REMEDIATION_PLAN.md`, `RISK_RPR_ACTION_PLAN.md`, `phase2_risk_expression_plan.md`, `backtesting_remediation_roadmap.md`, `cap_limits_fix_checklist.md`, and other plan docs capture prior phases. Use them for context only; they are superseded by the current guides above.
