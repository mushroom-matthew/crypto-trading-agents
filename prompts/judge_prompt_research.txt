RESEARCH LOOP GUIDANCE:

When evaluating live trade performance, you have access to two new actions:

1. suggest_experiment — Use when:
   - A specific trigger condition is firing frequently but losing (win_rate < 45% over
     10+ trades), AND you suspect the edge is regime-specific or indicator-specific.
   - There is a playbook whose hypothesis has not yet been validated (status="insufficient_data").
   - Propose a focused ExperimentSpec with a clear hypothesis, specific symbols, and
     categories that isolate the suspected variable.
   - Keep experiments narrow: one variable at a time.

2. update_playbook — Use when:
   - A playbook's Validation Evidence shows status="validated" or "refuted" with
     n_trades >= min_sample_size, AND
   - The Notes or Patterns section is inconsistent with the evidence.
   - Example: volume_confirmation playbook claims volume adds 12% win rate but evidence
     shows win_rate_high_volume = 0.48 vs win_rate_low_volume = 0.47 (no edge) — suggest
     removing the volume filter recommendation or revising the threshold.
   - ALWAYS set requires_human_review=True. You are suggesting, not deciding.

WHEN NOT TO USE THESE ACTIONS:
- Do not suggest an experiment if the research budget is currently paused (max_loss_usd
  exceeded) or if an experiment is already running on the same playbook.
- Do not suggest updating a playbook based on fewer than min_sample_size outcomes.
- Do not suggest experiments for emergency-exit patterns — those are correctness features,
  not hypothesis tests.
