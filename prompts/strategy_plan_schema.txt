STRATEGYPLAN SCHEMA (SHARED)

CRITICAL - Available Timeframes Constraint:
- The input includes "available_timeframes" in global_context listing which timeframes are loaded (e.g., ["5m", "1h", "4h"]).
- You may ONLY reference cross-timeframe indicators (tf_<timeframe>_<field>) for timeframes listed in available_timeframes.
- Triggers referencing unavailable timeframes will be BLOCKED and never fire.
- If only one timeframe is available, use ONLY direct indicators (close, ema_short, rsi_14) without tf_ prefixes.
- When multiple timeframes are available, use tf_<timeframe>_ prefixes for cross-timeframe confirmation.

Allowed Rule Identifiers (entry_rule/exit_rule/hold_rule may ONLY use these):
- Base indicators: symbol, timeframe, close, volume, volume_multiple, sma_short, sma_medium, sma_long, ema_short, ema_medium, ema_long, rsi_14, macd, macd_signal, macd_hist, atr_14, roc_short, roc_medium, realized_vol_short, realized_vol_medium, donchian_upper_short, donchian_lower_short, bollinger_upper, bollinger_lower, cycle_high_200, cycle_low_200, cycle_range_200, cycle_position, fib_236, fib_382, fib_500, fib_618, fib_786, last_expansion_pct, last_contraction_pct, expansion_contraction_ratio, ema_fast, ema_very_fast, realized_vol_fast, ewma_vol, vwap, vwap_distance_pct, vol_burst.
- Derived indicators: bollinger_middle, trend_state, vol_state.
- Position fields: position, is_flat, is_long, is_short, position_qty, position_value, entry_price, avg_entry_price, entry_side, position_opened_at.
- PnL and time-in-trade: unrealized_pnl_pct, unrealized_pnl_abs, unrealized_pnl, position_pnl_pct, position_pnl_abs, position_age_minutes, position_age_hours, holding_minutes, holding_hours, time_in_trade_min, time_in_trade_hours.
- Market-structure fields: nearest_support, nearest_resistance, distance_to_support_pct, distance_to_resistance_pct, trend, recent_tests.
- Cross-timeframe fields: tf_<timeframe>_<field> for any available_timeframes, including tf_<timeframe>_trend_state, tf_<timeframe>_vol_state, tf_<timeframe>_bollinger_middle.
- Numeric suffix aliases are allowed: any indicator ending in _NN may be referenced without the suffix (e.g., rsi_14 -> rsi, atr_14 -> atr, fib_236 -> fib). Aliases also work with tf_<timeframe>_ prefixes.

You MUST include the following top-level keys in every response:
- generated_at (ISO 8601 timestamp string)
- valid_until (ISO 8601 timestamp string)
- regime (one of: bull, bear, range, high_vol, mixed)
- risk_constraints (object)
- sizing_rules (array)
- triggers (array; can be empty but must exist)

Trigger schema (each item in triggers MUST include these keys):
- id (string)
- symbol (string, e.g., "BTC-USD")
- category (trend_continuation | reversal | volatility_breakout | mean_reversion | emergency_exit | other)
- confidence_grade (A | B | C)
- direction (long | short | exit)
- timeframe (e.g., "1h")
- entry_rule (string expression - NO subscript syntax like indicator[-1])
- exit_rule (string expression - NO subscript syntax like indicator[-1], can be empty for emergency exit)
- stop_loss_pct (REQUIRED for short entries): percentage-based stop distance (e.g., 2.0 means 2% stop)

IMPORTANT - Short entries:
- All short triggers MUST include stop_loss_pct. Short entries without stop_loss_pct will be BLOCKED.
- Example short trigger: {"direction": "short", "stop_loss_pct": 2.5, ...}

Do NOT use these keys in triggers: type, risk_grade.

Risk constraints MUST include:
- max_position_risk_pct
- max_symbol_exposure_pct
- max_portfolio_exposure_pct
- max_daily_loss_pct
- max_daily_risk_budget_pct (optional)

Sizing rules MUST include one entry per symbol. If unsure, use:
{ "symbol": "<SYMBOL>", "sizing_mode": "fixed_fraction", "target_risk_pct": <max_position_risk_pct> }
