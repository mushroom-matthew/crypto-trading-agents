STRATEGYPLAN SCHEMA (SHARED)

You MUST include the following top-level keys in every response:
- generated_at (ISO 8601 timestamp string)
- valid_until (ISO 8601 timestamp string)
- regime (one of: bull, bear, range, high_vol, mixed)
- risk_constraints (object)
- sizing_rules (array)
- triggers (array; can be empty but must exist)

Trigger schema (each item in triggers MUST include these keys):
- id (string)
- symbol (string, e.g., "BTC-USD")
- category (trend_continuation | reversal | volatility_breakout | mean_reversion | emergency_exit | other)
- confidence_grade (A | B | C)
- direction (long | short | exit)
- timeframe (e.g., "1h")
- entry_rule (string expression - NO subscript syntax like indicator[-1])
- exit_rule (string expression - NO subscript syntax like indicator[-1], can be empty for emergency exit)

Do NOT use these keys in triggers: type, risk_grade.

Risk constraints MUST include:
- max_position_risk_pct
- max_symbol_exposure_pct
- max_portfolio_exposure_pct
- max_daily_loss_pct
- max_daily_risk_budget_pct (optional)

Sizing rules MUST include one entry per symbol. If unsure, use:
{ "symbol": "<SYMBOL>", "sizing_mode": "fixed_fraction", "target_risk_pct": <max_position_risk_pct> }
